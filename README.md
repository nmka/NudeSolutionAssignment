My name is Nyamjav and this is my first time trying out dotnet core framework or c#. But it felt so familiar to me because i used to write on Java and Micronaut framework. I hope you like what i have done so far.


# NudeSolutionAssignment
- [x] Build/Run with Visual Studio 2019 or 2022, or the .NET CLI.

I builth it using Visual Studio 2022
- [x] Properly render in Chrome (latest version).

- [x] Allow a user to add an item with the following fields:
  o Name (text input).
  o Value (numeric input).
  o Category (dropdown list):

- done
- [ ] Adding/deleting/renaming of categories is not required.

- [x] This can be a static list of categories.

- I created initial dataseeder for category using migration
- [x] Allow a user to remove an item from the list.

- Done. I had two choise for creating endpoints. `/categories/1/items/3` or `/items/3` 
I chose unnested API endpoint because items have primary keys and so i don't need to provide category idea when i delete item.
Sometimes nested API endpoints makes sense in some situation but on this task i want things to be simple.

- [x] Display all items in a list, which is grouped and sorted by category.

- I queried categories with items as its property. So from api its comes like `categories.items`. This way makes sense for this task because requirement was to items to be grouped and sorted by category.

- [x] Display the summed value of all items belonging to a category.

- Did it in client side because it was easier to increase or decrease when we remove item or add item to category.
Other way would be getting it from backend and request everytime from backend after we add item or remove item to category. Which is not good.

- [x] Display the total summed value of all the items in the list.

i created CategoryValueSum reducer for category object and then using it to create TotalSummedValue reducer. DRY ;) 
- [x] Persist the data to a data store (SQL, NoSQL, LocalDB, anything is fine).

- Used localDB otherwise i have to setup docker for SQL server... I don't feel like it is important

- [x] Restore the data when the application is restarted.

- Done



Considerations and Rating

- [ ] General code quality and coding style.

As i said before its my first time setting up project on dotnet. I tried to follow official documentation from Microsoft https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/ for coding style and convention

- [ ] Total effort and polish applied to the application for the requirements that are scoped above.

- [ ] Understanding of design patterns supported by .NET Core, such as dependency injection.

- implemented dependency injection and log rotation. Not sure what other design patterns to implement. Task was simple but i tried to write testable code.

- [ ] Understanding of multi-tiered architectures and separation of concerns.

- Used Controller, Service, Repository pattern

* Controller: manages rest interface to business logic
* Service: manages business logic
* Repository: abstraction to database access.

- [ ] Understanding of the single responsibility principle, and other SOLID principles.

I felt like this assessment was too simple to demonstrate SOLID

- Single responsibility principle: All services repositories and controllers have single responsiblity
- Openâ€“closed principle: Well, they are open to Extension ;)
- Liskov substitution principle: 
- Interface segregation principle: All classes that fully implemented its interface 
- Dependency inversion principle: Controllers, Services and Respositories calling each other by interfaces

- [ ] Understanding of SPA concepts.
- To demonstrate I created single axios instance for fetching API 

- [ ] Understanding of how to write testable code.

- I demonstrated it by testing all services and controllers.
 
- [ ] Maintainability of the application if new features were to be added in the future.

- Separated modules by business domain
